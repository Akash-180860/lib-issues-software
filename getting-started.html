<h1>Getting Started with Library Issues List Software</h1>
<p dir="ltr">This software builds HTML issues lists from XML files. Tables of 
contents and index files are also created, also formatted in HTML. There is one input 
XML 
file for each issue. The file <code>config.xml</code> provides configuration 
attributes and text that tailors the output so that the same software works for 
the C++ Standard Library itself and also the various library Technical Specifications. It 
may also be useful for tracking issues for non-library documents, but most 
current use is with library related issues.</p>
<p>The code is written in C++ and requires a C++ 14 compiler and library. It is 
works on Linux, OS X, and Windows.</p>
<p>The source code should not require changes to be set up for a new IS or TS 
document. Please contact the maintainers if you need help.</p>
<h2><a name="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>Prerequisites for either setting up a new list or maintaining an existing 
list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> command line client. You can also 
  use a Git GUI client if you prefer. The <code>git</code> operations you will 
  need to maintain an issues list are baked into POSIX <code>.sh</code> and Windows 
  <code>.bat</code> scripts provided, so you do not need to be an experienced Git user.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> account.</li>
  <li>A C++ 14 compiler and library. At the moment, that means GCC 4.9 or later. No other libraries are required.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Repository organization and workflow</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/lib-issues-software">public Git 
repository</a> for the software is maintained on the C++ committee's
<a href="https://github.com/cplusplus">GitHub account</a>. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The
<a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Git Flow</a> 
model for repository workflow is at least roughly followed because it works well 
and is familiar to many developers. Because this is a simple project, only the
<i><b>master</b></i> and <b><i>develop</i></b> branches are always active. 
Feature branches are used when new features are under development.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Installation</h2>

<h3>POSIX</h3>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cd <b><i>some-directory</i></b>
git clone git@github.com:cplusplus/lib-issues-software.git
cd lib-issues-software
bin/build_pgms.sh</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cd <b><i>some-directory</i></b>
git clone git@github.com:cplusplus/lib-issues-software.git
cd lib-issues-software
bin\build_pgms</pre>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">These instructions assume you prefer to interact with GitHub via 
SSH.&nbsp; You can also use <code>https://github.com/cplusplus/lib-issues-software.git</code> 
as the URL in the instructions above; this may work better if you are behind a 
firewall.</p>

<h2>Directory structure</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Setup for a new issues list</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Set up a new repository containing only a README.md file on the ISO C++ 
  Standards Committee <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus">GitHub site</a>.</li>
  <li>Clone a working copy of the IS or TS repository on your local machine: 
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup to maintain an existing list</h2>
